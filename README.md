# Newspaper Logistics Efficiency 🗞️

A data-driven project analyzing and optimizing the operational efficiency of newspaper distribution using multi-stage DEA models.

## 📊 Key Features

- Applied **Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)** to evaluate performance efficiency across distribution hubs
- Built custom DEA models in Python using `numpy`, `pandas`, and visualization libraries
- Conducted **sensitivity analysis** to identify bottlenecks and guide resource realignment
- Created **interactive dashboards** to visualize operational efficiency metrics
- Enhanced delivery performance insights for logistics decision-makers

## 🧠 Tools & Tech Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Multi-stage DEA modeling
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 File

- `FinalCode.ipynb` – The complete notebook with DEA model implementation and analysis
